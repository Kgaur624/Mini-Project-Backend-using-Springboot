from LocationRepository we are going to load a new dataset, ( i will write finder () using HQL to
come up with the dataset.) within controller i will be using the dataset and i created ReportUtil class 
which the controller () will call again onces it load the dataset, the dataset will be 
handover to this utility, the utility will make use of the JFreeChart API and generate the JPEG and return


sql queries for reportutil
select type,count(type) from location group by type
